--- abstract

<!-- this edit removed line breaks, and added a comma and quotes -->

This document applies the Two-Week Principle (TWP) defined in RFC 9759 in the context of the long-running investigative model pioneered by the Mystery Inc. team,as seen in the animated documentary series, "Scooby-Doo". It outlines the observed cadence of mystery resolution, the strategic avoidance of adult supervision, and the repeatability of the Scooby Cycle within a fortnightly loop. The document aims to formalize the TWP and provide guidelines for implementation in adjacent problem-solving environments.

# Introduction

<!-- the following addition of quotes is clearer -->

The Scooby-Doo team (consisting of Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley,
Norville "Shaggy" Rogers, and Scooby-Doo) has, over decades of episodic
documentation, demonstrated a reliable pattern of encountering and resolving
complex hauntings, heists, and hoaxes. The "Two-Week Principle" (TWP) [RFC9759] posits
that very sufficiently complex mystery can be encountered, analyzed, and
unmasked within two weeks, but only if snacks are adequately supplied.

TWP is a revolutionary method that does the following: converts all time
measurements into a universally accepted standard of two weeks and
standardizes all temporal references.

## Terminology

* The Two-Week Principle (TWP): This rule states that any given time duration,
regardless of original or intended value, must be converted to two weeks. TWP
is formally defined in RFC9759.

* Time Normalization Compliance (TNC): A system, organization, or individual
is TNC-compliant if all time values <!-- this is what a comment looks like when it's added to the middle of a paragraph

communicated. Section 3 discusses more on compliance.

* Snacks: Motivational units primarily in the form of Scooby Snacks or 3-foot
tall sandwiches.

# Conversion Guidelines

Section 3 of RFC9759 provides a mapping of time units in TWP.

# Implementation Considerations

Per Section 4 of RFC9759, implementors should consider the following:

* Software Compliance
* Project Management
* iCalendar Format Updates
* Business Communications

This section describes these considerations as applied to the operations of
Mystery Inc.

{:vspace}
Software Compliance:
: Implementing TWP in software compliance for Scooby Doo’s digital
infrastructure (e.g., mobile games, streaming apps, or fan portals) means
establishing automated, biweekly checks for adherence to data protection
regulations and licensing terms.  All interfaces SHOULD replace time values
with "two weeks." Such applications have TNC (see Section 1.1).

Project Management:
: Using TWP in Scooby Doo project management means structuring workflows
around two-week sprints or check-ins. Whether it's a new animated short,
mobile game feature, or merch drop, breaking work into two-week deliverables
promotes momentum and adaptability. Tools like Jira or Trello can track these
sprint-based tasks, with biweekly retrospectives helping refine the process
over time.

<!-- some text updates below -->

: Team roles should be clearly defined within this cycle -- Fred as project
lead, Velma handling analysis and documentation, Daphne overseeing marketing,
and Shaggy and Scooby performing QA (especially anything
food-related!). TWP ensures everyone’s aligned, bottlenecks are caught early,
and projects stay responsive to feedback or creative shifts.

iCalendar Format Updates:
: For Scooby Doo events, coordination, and content publishing, implementing
TWP means scheduling a regular review and update of iCalendar (.ics) files
every two weeks. This includes confirming date accuracy, event metadata, and
time zone consistency.

Business Communications:
: Applying TWP to business communications means sending regular, biweekly
updates to partners, sponsors, and internal stakeholders. This might take the
form of newsletters, recap emails, or sync meetings.

# Post-Quantum Effects

Imagine the Scooby-Doo gang is protecting a treasure chest (your data) using a
lock (encryption). Right now, the locks they use are super hard to
break—unless someone has thousands of years. But then a quantum
computer shows up, like some high-tech ghost. And this quantum ghost can pick
those locks really fast using its spooky quantum powers (like Shor’s
algorithm).

That's what the post-quantum world is about: the gang realizes their old
tricks won't work forever, and they need new locks. See Sections 5 and 6 of
RFC8784.

TWP is about urgency. Once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer exists,
any delay—even a short one—could leave years of data vulnerable. It’s like if
you wait too long to set a trap for the ghost, and they already escaped with
the treasure.

# Security Considerations

The gang always reveals the villain in the end. In security, audit logs and
access reviews serve the same purpose—ensuring every action is traceable and
no one can operate in secret for too long. Even trusted team members like
Shaggy or Scooby could accidentally cause chaos (usually by running from
ghosts). TWP ensures that even trusted roles are subject to regular access
reviews and expiration policies.

The security considerations in Section 6 of RFC 8784 apply. The security
considerations in RFC 9354, Section 8 also apply.

# IANA

IANA is requested to add "mystery-twp" to the "TLS Alerts" registry.

# Conclusion
By adopting the Two-Week Principle, the Mystery Inc., team will
standardize time estimation, eliminating stress, miscommunication, and
disappointment. This RFC strongly recommends immediate implementation. The
mapping in Section 2 SHOULD be used.

# Acknowledgements

The authors would like to extend their sincere gratitude to the Mystery
Inc. team -- Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley,
Shaggy Rogers, and Scooby Doo -— for decades of tireless fieldwork
in uncovering the mechanics of mystery and their efforts to implement TWP.
